# Bulletin Board Application

This project has been build in course of my bachelors thesis. 
It provides a small bulletin board application, that allows users to register using a pseudonym and share 
thoughts about personal and confidential information. 

The project has been build using the MERN-Stack.

Seperatly run ```npm install``` inside the backend directory and src directory.
